Module 2 project: Basic Web App
Part 1: Bootstrapping the project
Ran into some confusion while getting everything installed and running properly due to not pulling everything into a root directory at first. Once I got that sorted out, I was able to get the project bootstrapped into Visual Studio Code and was able to go about the rest of the file modification without trouble.
Part 2: Debugging
Added the Vue dev tools Chrome extension. Played around with it for a bit. Clicked on the calculate button to see the value of “null” change to the calculated number in the dev tools under “data.” Tested making a syntax error on purpose and the dev tools makes a huge message on the screen showing the error.
Par 3: Deploying
Found where to change dist to docs and remove the ‘\’ so that it wouldn’t be looking for a root directory. Ran the commit and push commands. And hopefully this is showing in my GH repo correctly and app is running. 

**Failed a first few attempts to get this read me added. Realized I forgot to save the changes first before trying to commit and push.it
